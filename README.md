Getting started to know the assembly language <br />
based on Intel x86 syntax
## what you will see here
- [x] Wet exercises on aseembly languege including some small funtions.
- [x] Dry excrcise in order to get you to know the assembly syntax and operations.

## Folder structure
You must have the following folder structure to be able to run the tests

project:
  * tests:
    * test_1_1.sh
    * test_2_1.sh
    * test_3_1.sh
    * test_4_1.sh
    * test_5_1.sh
  * ex1.asm
  * ex2.asm
  * ex3.asm
  * ex4.asm
  * ex5.asm
  * run_test.sh
## How to run tests
On your linux you will likely be able to run it with <br />
for example test1 on ex1:
```
./run_test.sh ex1.asm tests/test_1_1
```
if the command will return an error you probably should run this command first:
```
chmod +x <your .sh file>
```
